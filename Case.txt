**HONORABLE JUDGE:** The Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge presiding over this case is myself, and I will ensure a fair and impartial trial.

**COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES:**

* Mr. S. K. Dey, Advocate for B.N. Das (the Workman)

**OPENING STATEMENTS**

The Court will now hear the opening statements from both parties. Mr. Sharma, you may proceed on behalf of the Phulbari Tea Estate.

**MR. R. K. SHARMA:** Your Honor, the Phulbari Tea Estate respectfully submits that the Industrial Tribunal's decision to set aside the dismissal of B.N. Das was erroneous and not sustainable in law. The Tribunal failed to appreciate the evidence presented during the enquiry, which clearly established the workman's guilt. Furthermore, the Tribunal's finding on the improper procedure is also flawed, as the Company had followed the necessary protocols.

The Company challenges the Tribunal's competence under Section 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and questions the Tribunal's award, which appears to sit in appeal on the enquiry held by the Company. We pray that this Court may set aside the Tribunal's award and allow the Company's appeal.

**HONORABLE JUDGE:** Thank you, Mr. Sharma. Mr. Dey, please proceed with your opening statement on behalf of B.N. Das.

**MR. S. K. DEY:** Your Honor, the workman, B.N. Das, was unfairly dismissed from his employment on charges of theft. The Industrial Tribunal, after a thorough examination of the evidence, rightly found that the dismissal was not justified due to improper procedure and lack of legal evidence.

The Company's enquiry was grossly unfair, as the workman was not given a chance to cross-examine the witnesses against him, nor was he provided with copies of their statements. The Tribunal's decision to award compensation to the workman was, therefore, justified and in accordance with the law.

We pray that this Court may uphold the Tribunal's award and dismiss the Company's appeal.

**HONORABLE JUDGE:** Thank you, Mr. Dey. The Court has heard the opening statements from both parties. The
